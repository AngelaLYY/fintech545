    "#### My approach for this question:\n",
    "For the problem, I generate a standard normal distribution so the skewness and kurtosis are expected to be 0. In the code below, I first parse the dataset from csv file and use the data to generate results using normalized formula from the lecture, and use the standard package scipy to calculate the same. The results are exactly the same or very close. Then I use t-test to test at significance level of 95% to see if my package is biased or not. "

    "### a. MLE method and compare with OLS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### My approach:\n",
    "For this problem, I aimed to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model using both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) methods. I began by reading the dataset from a CSV file and defined the predictor variable (x) and the response variable (y). Using the statsmodels library, I performed the OLS regression by fitting a linear model to the data. This provided estimates for the regression coefficients (betas) and their standard errors. Next, I implemented a custom negative log-likelihood function for the linear regression model and utilized the minimize function from scipy.optimize to maximize the likelihood function. This allowed me to estimate the regression coefficients and the error variance using the MLE method. After obtaining the estimates from both OLS and MLE methods, I compared the estimated regression coefficients and error variance. Despite minor differences, I found that the estimates obtained from both methods were largely consistent. Based on the results, I concluded that the estimated coefficients and error variance obtained from OLS and MLE were similar, indicating the robustness of the estimation methods. Any slight discrepancies observed could be attributed to computational nuances or differences in the optimization process.\n",

This function takes parameters such as means (mu1, mu2), standard deviations (sigma1, sigma2), and correlation coefficient (rho) as inputs. \n",

After optimization, I extract the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) parameters to obtain the estimated means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficient. I plot the observed data points of X1 and X2 along with the expected value of X2 given each observed value of X1. This allows me to visualize the relationship between the two variables. Additionally, I compute the 95% confidence interval for X2 based on the estimated parameters. This provides insights into the uncertainty associated with the expected value of X2.\n",
